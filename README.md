Game idea generator, written in Kotlin



# Ideas
- Connect to GitHub Pages
- Look up popular (or any) game jam ideas/restrictions
- Maybe use keywords 'Game Jam Idea Generator'
- Have an option to 'Add restriction to idea' and 'Remove restriction from idea' and 'Save idea'  and 'Customize possible restriction' (add and remove)
- Should be able to run this offline (from local cache)
